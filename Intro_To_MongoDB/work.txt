1.Create a database called 'my_first_db'.
> use my_first_db

2.Create students collection.
> db.createCollection("students")

3.Each document you insert into this collection should have the following
 format: ({name: STRING, home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER,
 birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})

4.Create 5 students with the appropriate info.
> db.students.insert({name:"Alf", home_state:"WA", lucky_number:99,
  birthday: {month: 1, day: 1, year: 2000}})
> db.students.insert({name:"Bill", home_state:"WA", lucky_number:13,
  birthday: {month: 2, day: 2, year: 2001}})
> db.students.insert({name:"Chuck", home_state:"WA", lucky_number:9,
  birthday: {month: 3, day: 3, year: 2002}})
> db.students.insert({name:"Dill", home_state:"WA", lucky_number:7,
  birthday: {month: 4, day: 4, year: 2003}})
> db.students.insert({name:"Elric", home_state:"WA", lucky_number:666,
  birthday: {month: 5, day: 5, year: 2004}})

5.Get all students.
> db.students.find().pretty()

6.Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington
 (Seattle Dojo).
> db.students.find({home_state: { $in: ["WA", "CA"]}}).pretty()

7. Get all students whose lucky number is:
  a)greater than 3
  b)less than or equal to 10
  c)between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
> db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}}).pretty()
> db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}}).pretty()
> db.students.find({$and: [{lucky_number:{$lte: 9}},{lucky_number:{$gte: 1}}]}).pretty()

8. Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.
  It should contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'.
  Do this in ONE operation.
